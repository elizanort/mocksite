        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>Hi there! I'm Garrett. I'm 25, and from Indianapolis, Indiana.
            Some of my favorite things to do include listening to music,
            drawing, and meditation. I'm currently in a training program learning
            User Experience Design with Kenzie Academy.
        </p>
        <p>I hope to focus on the design portion of the process in future
            employment. I enjoy the creation process of how user research
            is utilized to manifest sensible, efficient, and polished
            user interface design. Here are some skills I hope to use
            regularly in a job:
            <ul>
                <li>Animation</li>
                <li>Material Design System</li>
                <li>Illustration</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
